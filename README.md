# Rain_Alerts 
In this project, I utilized the openweathermap API to track the weather of a user-inputted longitude and latitude location over a 24 hour period and prints out a statement indicating whether or not to bring an umbrella based on if there is precipitation predicted during any hours of the day.  This project was created as part of a Udemy Course- 100 Days of Code:The Complete Python Bootcamp for 2022.
